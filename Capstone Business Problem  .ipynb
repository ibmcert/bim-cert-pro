They are confident in their culinary skills and convinced that their new business venture will be a success if they can find a great location for their restaurant. They hired John, a Chicago native who recently open a marketing consulting business after working for a large analytics consulting firm for several years. The young couple would like the restaurant to meet the following requirements:\n1. Target customers: tourists, business employees and local residents who are looking for delicious lunch or dinners \n2. Private residence: since they are new to the city they would like to reside in a safe neighborhood they can return to after long hours at the restaurant. \n3. Commute: they will prefer a short commute since they will be spending most of their day at the restaurant. \n4. School: they also have a young child and would like him to attend an elementary school with good safety and college enrollment records \n5. Deleverables: they would like John to recommend a list of three locations on a Chicago map that meet the above four requirements"
